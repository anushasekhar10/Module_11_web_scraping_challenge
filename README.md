# Module_11_web_scraping_challenge

**Module 11 Challenge**

Part of this challenge we will perform two activities

1: Scrape titles and preview text from Mars news articles.

2: Scrape and analyze Mars weather data

**For Part 1**

We will use Automated browsing (with Splinter) to visit the Mars news site, and extract the HTML code with Beautiful Soup.

Store the scraped information in Python data structureâ€”specifically, a list of dictionaries

**For Part 2**

Extract the HTML table into a Pandas DataFrame and leverage either Pandas or Splinter and Beautiful Soup to scrape the data. 

Perform some data analysis to get key insights into the data
